Day 1 - Monday
What we did today was first, we were given our entry cards for us to be able to enter at the front door and office. We were then brought to a room where we did briefing on what red hat, get to know interns, gave us our schedule for the week and did an icebreaker where we were put on names on the back and you have to ask 3 questions per person and try to guess who you are. We then met Becky, who gave us the tour around the building. They then assigned us to our desk and supplied us laptops. To pass time, we all played Nintendo switch and played the game Mario race and I conclude that I am really bad at doing games. We then have our lunch for an hour and then proceeded to the workshop of Agile by Sir Fortune. He talked to us about what agile and agility is and how important it is for you to have this kind of skill and ability. We were then grouped to create a villain kind of Mr potato and before assembling it, my group mates and I planned on who's going to get what. It was really good because it helped us communicate with each other despite just knowing each other that day. We finished early than expected and the whole day was really fun and chill that I enjoyed every bit of it.
